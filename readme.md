Note: This chrome plugin is just for me to save some pages. It's not widely for common useage.
BUt you can change it with you suitable.

Main function is in `js/clean.js` and `js/popup.js`, before i try to save pages as pdf with printer, i used `jsPDF`, but there something was wrong, i can't make it convert to pdf from html(text isn't problem).

Also, It's funny to learn how to write a chrome extension.
